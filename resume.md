## My skills:
### **backend:**
Have a strong experiance with microservices and big data </br>
Always prefer to code on backend
 
`nodejs` <sub>`(express nestjs loopback)`</sub> - main language </br>
`python` <sub>`(django)`</sub> - 1 year exp, my first language</br>
`rust` - on project, some of microservices was on it. So... I have to learn rust)</br>
`graphql` </br>
`sockets` </br>
